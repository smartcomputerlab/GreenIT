# GreenIT and IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses the significant projected expansion of in-network utilization and node count. As a result, it is necessary to lower the resources required to implement all network parts and their energy. Energy consumption is becoming state-of-the-art to ensure the reliability of the Internet of Things and the deployment of an intelligent world. The IoT must be energy efficient to mitigate the greenhouse impact and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from sensors, devices, apps, and services to achieve a sustainable, innovative world.
In this context we are concerned by the applications related to the use and deployment of Low and Very Low Power IoT Architectures.
These low «power aspects» include the sensing, the processing, and the IoT data transmission operations. They may be attained via:

    1. The choice of power efficient sensors and sensing modes/cycles
    2. The selection of Ultra Low Processing units (ULP) often based on RISC-V processors.
    3. The reduction or “IoT data stream compression” to limit the transmission energy.
